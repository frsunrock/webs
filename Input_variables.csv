grid_soc_trigger,Grid SOC trigger,1.0,"The battery state of charge limit below which the grid starts charging the battery. If 1, available grid capacity always charges the battery (useful in limited grid connection). If 0, battery is never charged by the gird but only by solar. If 0.3, when the battery state of charge is below 30% the grid starts charging the battery. "
